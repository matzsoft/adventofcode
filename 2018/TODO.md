## Day03 - No Matter How You Slice It
This is the one in which the Elves are trying to fix Santa's suit.  They each make a claim on part of the available fabric. I think there should be a nice recursive solution for part1 but I can't figure out the proper way to end the recursion.
## Day11 - Chronal Charge
This one is about optimizing the power output from a grid of power cells. Part 2 takes over a minute.  I should be able to speed it up.
## Day14 - Chocolate Charts
The Elves are trying to optimize hot chocolate recipes.  My part2 is too slow and I would like to speed it up.
## Day15 - Beverage Bandits
This one is about the Goblins and Elves battling over hot chocolate.  My solution needs to be cleaned up and optimized.
