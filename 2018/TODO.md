1. day03 - I think there should be a nice recursive solution for part1 but I can't figure out the proper way to end the recursion.
1. day11 - Part 2 takes over a minute.  Should be able to speed it up.
1. day14 - is there a way to speed up Part 2?
1. day15 - needs cleanup and speedup.
1. day17 - way too slow.
1. day23 - either fully understand part2 or develop a more general solution.
