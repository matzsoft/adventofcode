1. day18 - can it be implemented with a code optimizer instead of reverse engineering the input?
1. day22 - should probably be implemented with a sparse array instead of allocating a big array to start.
1. day23 - can it be implemented with a code optimizer instead of reverse engineering the input?
1. day25 - should be faster.  Is it the tape implementation?
