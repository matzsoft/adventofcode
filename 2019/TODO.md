1. day 13 - would be nice to produce an animated image of part2.
1. day 17 - need to generalize part 2 to handle other inputs.
1. day 18 - seems overly complicated and could run faster.
1. day 19 - compute commands in part 2 instead of hard coding them.
1. day 21 - the solution essentially hard codes the answers.  There is support code in there to help determine what the hard coding should be.  day21a is a step in the direction of computing the required commands.  It would be nice to get that to work.
