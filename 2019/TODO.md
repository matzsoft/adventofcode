1. day 13 - would be nice to produce an animated image of part2.
1. day 17 - need to generalize part 2 to handle other inputs.
1. day 18 - seems overly complicated and could run faster.
1. day 19 - compute commands in part 2 instead of hard coding them.
1. day 21 - the solution essentially hard codes the answers.  There is support code in there to help determine what the hard coding should be.  day21a is a step in the direction of computing the required commands.  It would be nice to get that to work.
1. day 22 - requires referencing a BigInt package from github.  Need a way to have that work through the adventOfCode tool.
1. day 23 - part 2 takes 30+ seconds.  Can that be reduced?
1. day 25 - solution is not general.  Need to develop a solution that works for any input. Possibilties from most satisfying to least satisfying:
    1. A solution that plays the game, mapping the area and learns which are the safe items, then works out which of the safe items provide the corect weight.
    1. A solution which interprets the input to get the information needed to correctly play the game.
    1. A solution which extracts the answer directly from the input.
