1. day 05 - Can it be sped up?
1. day 13 - Instead of creating an abitrarily large Floor to start, start small and expand it as needed during traversal.
1. day 14 - Part 2  is too slow (almost 25 minute).  Can I speed it up?
1. day 16 - despite the copious comments it still takes 16 hours to run part 2.
1. day 18 - Part 2 is too slow (almost 90 seconds).  Can I speed it up?  Also add tests now that I have extras.
