1. day08 - Should work on the BlockLetter stuff.  It needs cleanup, moved to the library, and fill out the alphabet.
1. day12 - Ideally should create an Assembunny(RISC) to Assembunny(CISC) optimizer to solve the problem generally.
1. day13 - Instead of creating an abitrarily large Floor to start, start small and expand it as needed during traversal.
1. day14 - Part 2  is too slow (almost 25 minute).  Can I speed it up?
1. day16 - Performance is acceptable, not great.  May be able to improve by merging the fill and checksum phases into one.
