1. day13 - Instead of creating an abitrarily large Floor to start, start small and expand it as needed during traversal.
1. day14 - Part 2  is too slow (almost 25 minute).  Can I speed it up?
1. day18 - Part 2 is too slow (almost 90 seconds).  Can I speed it up?
1. General - I currently don't have a way to implement tests for problems like day18 where the test needs more input than the actual problem.
