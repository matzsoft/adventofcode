# adventofcode
These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) problems.  There is a directory for each year and a tools directory.

I solved the 2015 problems in Perl, but decided to switch to Swift for 2016.  For 2021 I have created a new structure, see `tools/adventOfCode/README.md` for details.  I recently converted all the 2016 through 2020 files to the new format.  Next I will reimplement all the 2015 problems in Swift.
