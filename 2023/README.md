### Day 12

Part 2 needs to be sped up. One potential way is to recognize that if all the arrangements in the first fold end the same way, there is no need to calculate the other folds.

### Day 19

I would like to speed up part 2. I believe one possible way is to replace the use of Set with a new type that behaves the same externally but uses a list of Ranges internally.

### Day 21

Part 2 is a complete mess and doesn't even solve the general problem. It only works on my data and not even on the examples. It uses a bunch of numbers derived by looking at my data with the help of the program. Then I took the numbers and just output the result. I need to write code that will determine those numbers for any data.

### Day 25

Takes 10 minutes to run. Must be a more efficient way.
