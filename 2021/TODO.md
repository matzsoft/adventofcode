## day15 - Chiton
This is the one where you must navigate a 2D matrix of risk levels from upper left to lower right while minimizing the total risk.  Can part2 be sped up even more?
## day23 - Amphipod
In this one you must shuffle 4 types of amphipods from 4 side rooms through a hallway so that each side room contains all of one type of amphipod.  Make it work with A* and compare times.
