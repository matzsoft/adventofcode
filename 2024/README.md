## TODO

### Day 6

Part 2 runs in about .5s (release build) which is acceptable but hardly fast. Are there further optimizations that can be performed?

### Day 7

Part 2 still takes 20 seconds which is a big improvement but there must be more I can do.

### Day 14

Think about supporting OutputType other than yes and by default no. Also turns out my solution does not work for all data.

### Day 16

Needs speed up for both parts.

### Day 18

Now only part 2 is too slow.

### Day 24

Looking for more data to insure that my solution works in all cases. Got up to JAntaresN in the subreddit with no luck.
